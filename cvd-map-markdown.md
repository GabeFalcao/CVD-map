# Introduction

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the USA, accounting for approximately 1 in every 4 deaths (@ref). **I will write more about introduction and include some figures in the next few days**.

## Prerequisites

To perform these maps, you will need to have several extra packages. I'm not going into how to install them, but a quick google search should tell you how to. The main libraries that we will need are:

1. [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): this is a package created by Hadley Wickham. This "umbrella" package was designed to make data science analysis and visualition faster and easier. The main packages that we will use in this analysis are:
  + [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/): grammar of data manipulation, i.e. how to import, select, filter, and arrange your data for analysis;
  + [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): system for declaratively creating graphics, i.e. you provide the data, tell it how to map, and it takes care of details.
